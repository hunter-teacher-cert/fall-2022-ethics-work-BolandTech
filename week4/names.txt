I am not sure that this is going to work. I am trying to make the Regex programto work on the name list I created above.  The list I created includes a variation of names, including first, last, title, middle name, and hyphenated name combinations.  Some lines have single names while others have multiple names on the same line separated by commas.  Hopefully, this works!
